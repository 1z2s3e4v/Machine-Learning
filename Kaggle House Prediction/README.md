# Hear is my code in kaggle competition: 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques'  

I seperate the code to three parts:  
1. Feature engineering 
2. Model tunning  
3. Model ensembling and prediction  

In the first code I clean the dataset and do the feature engineer for the training and testing set.  
Second code I tuning the regression model to find the best parameter for the prediction.  
The third code I use the ensemble method to combine the regression model for reducing the variation.  

This compitition my best rank is top 21%.  

If you have any good suggestion for my code, please feel free to let me know.  
Thanks a lot!!
